"""Figure S7: measurement of the instrumental speckle contrast beta.

beta is a property of the beamline -- the transverse coherence of the incident
beam and the speckle-to-pixel size ratio -- not of the sample, so it is measured
once on a STATIC reference and then held fixed in every g2 fit.  A static sample
has no decorrelation, so its correlation function is flat at

    g2(tau) = 1 + beta.

Reference: nano-porous glass, 10 nm nominal pore diameter, 10 x 10 mm, 1.2 mm
thick (Doraglas S10-10-1200-50).  Dataset F0145, 6 C, 50 repeat acquisitions of
100,000 frames each, taken at 19:49 on 2022-03-06 -- about two hours before the
isothermal series of Figure 3 (21:57), in the same beamline configuration.  This
script reads the group average that average_ranges.py writes into data/, on the
same terms as every other group in the paper: the two outlier cuts leave 41 of
the 50 acquisitions, and those 41 are averaged.  Nothing here touches the
beamline storage.

Panel (a): the averaged g2 at q = 0.00376 A^-1, the lowest of the five bins the
sample is analysed in, with its measured pointwise uncertainties and the
straight-line fit in log(delay) that a static sample requires.  It is flat to
0.3 sigma with a reduced chi^2 of 0.71.

Panel (b): the same constant fitted bin by bin, giving beta(q).  The ADOPTED
value is the unweighted mean over the five bins the sample is analysed in,

    beta = 0.13139 +/- 0.00056,

the error being the standard error of that mean; the five are 0.12948, 0.13124,
0.13291, 0.13145 and 0.13186 at q = 0.00376, 0.00489, 0.00602, 0.00714 and
0.00827 A^-1, and every one of them is flat (reduced chi^2 <= 1.03).  Measuring
beta in the same q range it is applied in removes the only assumption the older
choice needed, that the plateau in panel (b) extends down from q = 0.02067 A^-1
to the sample range.  It does: the strongest-counted flat bin, bin 16 at
q = 0.02067 A^-1, returns 0.13031, within one standard error of the adopted
mean, and the bin-to-bin spread of beta falls as 1/sqrt(N) with the number of
acquisitions averaged, so it is counting noise rather than a real q dependence.
The two choices differ by 0.8 %, and moving between them shifts every fitted
fast fraction by less than 0.02.

Four of the 27 bins are excluded from panel (b) and flagged in the print-out
(bins 7, 12, 15 and 22): their averaged correlation function is not flat,
reduced chi^2 > 5 against a constant.  All four lie at q >= 0.0105 A^-1, above
the range used for the sample.

Panel (b) is flat at about 0.132 out to q ~ 0.021 A^-1 and then falls off,
reaching 0.107 in the outermost bin at q = 0.0331 A^-1.  That falloff is real
and instrumental, not a defect of the standard: the 0.03 % bandwidth passed by
the Si(111) monochromator at 10.91 keV gives a finite LONGITUDINAL coherence
length, and the path-length difference across the scattering volume grows with
scattering angle, so contrast is progressively lost as q rises.  All five bins
used for the sample sit well below that onset.
