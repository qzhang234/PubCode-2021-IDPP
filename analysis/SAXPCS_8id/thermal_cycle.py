"""Figure S4: thermal-cycling repeatability of (VPAVG)30 at 8-ID-I.

The direct reversibility control for the SA-XPCS experiment: ONE aliquot taken
through seven consecutive 6 -> 34 -> 6 C cycles.  Figure 2 sets two separate
12-ID-B aliquots against each other; here every curve is the same material, so
a difference between cycles could only be irreversibility.

It is NOT the same loading as Figure 3.  This is sample S1, measured 2022-03-04;
Figure 3 is sample S3_7, measured 2022-03-06.  Both are aliquots of the same
stock, measured in cell position B of the same nine-position Quantum Northwest
holder during the same beamtime, but position B was reloaded in between.  Do not
write "the same aliquot as Figure 3" anywhere.

This loading was the less completely dissolved of the two: I(0.004)/I(0.02) =
4.0 against 2.7, and transmission 0.305 against 0.333.  Its 6 C state also
carries transient large scatterers.  Within one 6 C group the per-acquisition
intensity at 0.0035 A^-1 is strongly right-skewed (B0083: 96 % RSD, maximum 8x
the median) while the SAME acquisitions at 0.03 A^-1 are symmetric at ordinary
counting statistics.  That is what a large object crossing the 10 x 10 um beam
during a minority of acquisitions looks like.

SPIKE REMOVAL.  outlier_removal() does not catch those: it cuts on the SHAPE of
log10 I(q) over the whole q range, and a curve that is 8x high in three low-q
bins alone stays nearly parallel to the group mean.  spike_removal() in
average_ranges.py is the second cut that does, and it is applied to every group
in the paper on the same terms.  In the seven 6 C groups it removes 4, 2, 1, 11,
4, 1 and 1 acquisitions and 2 and 7 from the two buffers, and none at all from
the fourteen 34 C windows.  The cycle-to-cycle RSD of the 6 C state falls from
12.6 % to 8.6 %, leaving a monotone rise over the last two cycles rather than
one contaminated group.  The threshold is not tuned: the same acquisitions are
selected for any value between 2.5 and 3, and for two other choices of band.

WHY CYCLE 4 STOOD OUT, in two different ways, neither of them irreversibility.
At 6 C it was four acquisitions, not the group: its MEDIAN sat squarely inside
the spread of the other six, while four of its 43 survivors read 4-8x that
median, at scattered frame numbers.  At 31.9 C it was not an outlier at all;
that cycle's window simply landed hotter.  The seven ramps cross acquisitions
241-250 between 31.62 and 32.48 C, and on the steep part of the transition ln I
tracks that spread almost perfectly (r = 0.974, d lnI/dT = 0.95 /C).

Layout (double column):
  top    - measured sample temperature through the whole 5 h 47 min sequence
  bottom - left:  SAXS I(Q) at the three states sampled in every cycle
           right: g2 at the lowest Q for the two high-temperature states

Run sequence, each 2 s acquisition at a previously unexposed position:
    B0075 6 C  ->  B0076 ramp to 34 C  ->  D0077 buffer, cooling
    B0078 6 C  ->  B0079 ramp to 34 C  ->  D0080 buffer, cooling
    B0081/83/85/87/89 6 C, each followed by a ramp B0082/84/86/88/90.
Each ramp is 270 acquisitions from 6.13 to 34.00 C in 27.7 min, 1.01 C/min.
The first two cool-downs were recorded by the buffer runs.  No acquisitions were
taken during the other five, so NO TEMPERATURE WAS RECORDED there; those
intervals are reconstructed from the fixed control protocol (cool at 10 C/min to
6 C, then hold) and drawn dashed.  Every solid segment is measured.

Temperatures come from /entry/sample/qnw1_temperature.  The stage has three
zones holding nine cells, and the sample letter selects the zone (A-C -> qnw1,
D-F -> qnw2, G-I -> qnw3), so the B-series sample sits in qnw1 and the D-series
buffer in qnw2.  qnw2 reads 6.00 C throughout: the buffer was held cold all
along.

Absolute scale and background subtraction follow Figure 3 exactly.  Each group
average is put on an absolute differential cross section by abs_xsec_coef() from
that group's own mean ion-chamber readings, and the averaged buffer (D0077 +
D0080, 69 surviving of 89 acquisitions) is subtracted with no empirical scale
factor.  The two buffer measurements agree to within 6 % at every q below
0.01 A^-1, so neither is scaled against the other.

EVERY average here runs over the surviving acquisitions and only those, because
all of them are keyed to the /xpcs/average/file_list that average_ranges.py
wrote beside the averaged curves.  The temperature TRACE of panel (a) is the
deliberate exception: it is the thermal history of the experiment, not an
average, and an acquisition whose scattering was rejected still records the
temperature the sample was at.

This script reads nothing from the beamline storage.  Its inputs are the files
average_ranges.py writes into data/: one averaged file per group, and
thermal_cycle_temperature.csv, the per-acquisition thermal history.

# The buffer is only about a third of the 6 C signal at low q (buffer/sample =
# 0.35 at 0.0035 A^-1), so flattening the slope means subtracting most of the
# low-q signal: at BG = 2.5 it destroys 78 % of it, turns the slope positive,
# and degrades the cycle-to-cycle repeatability -- the actual result of this
# figure -- from 8.6 % to 23 %, while leaving the 34 C curves untouched
# (4.8 % either way).  A "background" term that changes one curve by 78 % and
# another by 0.4 % is not a shared background.
# The residual low-q rise is therefore treated as sample or cell-window

# --- ONE key for the whole figure, drawn by hand ---
# matplotlib's legend can only lay an entry out as handle-then-label, left
# aligned, which cannot produce the layout this key needs: a column header
# CENTRED over its markers, and row labels flush RIGHT against the marker grid.
# The key is therefore drawn directly in figure coordinates -- a 7 x 3 matrix of
# markers, the cycle numbers centred over their columns on the same line as the
# title, the temperature labels right aligned against the grid, and a frame
# around the whole thing.  Everything is sized in POINTS off the one font size,
# so the key scales with the style rather than with the figure.
