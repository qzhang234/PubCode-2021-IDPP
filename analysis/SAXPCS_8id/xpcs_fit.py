"""Shared XPCS two-mode fit: the model, the measured contrast, and the global fit.

Figure 3b,c, Figure S8 and Figure S9 must all show the SAME model applied the
SAME way -- Figure S9 is an expansion of Figure 3b onto the four higher q bins
-- so the model and the fitting routine live here and every figure script
imports them.  (Before this module, g2_grid_SI.py carried its own copy that
fitted each q bin independently with the stretching exponents frozen at 0.5, so
Figure S9 was showing a different model from the one its caption described.)

CONTRAST
--------
beta is the instrumental speckle contrast: a property of the beam coherence and
the detector pixel size, not of the sample.  It is therefore measured once, on a
static reference, and held fixed for every sample fit.

The value below was measured on the 10 nm nano-porous glass standard (Doraglas
S10-10-1200-50, 10 mm x 1.2 mm, 10 nm pores), dataset F0145, at 6 C.  The value
comes from the group average average_ranges.py writes into data/ -- 41 of the 50
acquisitions, the survivors of the same two outlier cuts every other group in
the paper gets -- and it is measured in the SAME five q bins the sample is
fitted in, which is where it is used.  A constant is fitted to the averaged g2
of each, as a static sample requires; the five are flat (reduced chi^2 0.71 to
1.03) and return 0.12948, 0.13124, 0.13291, 0.13145 and 0.13186, whose mean is

    g2 = 1 + beta,   beta = 0.13139 +/- 0.00056,

the error being the standard error of that mean.  The strongest-counted flat bin
anywhere, bin 16 at q = 0.02067 A^-1, gives 0.13031, within one standard error,
so nothing hinges on the choice: moving between the two shifts every fitted fast
fraction by less than 0.02.
