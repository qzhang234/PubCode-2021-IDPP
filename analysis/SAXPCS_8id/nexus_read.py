"""Where things live inside an 8-ID-I averaged HDF file, and how to read them.

The averaged NeXus files written by `average_ranges.py` all have the same
layout, and four of the figure scripts here (`saxpcs.py`, `saxs_evolution.py`,
`g2_grid_SI.py`, `thermal_cycle.py`) need the same handful of quantities out of
them: when the acquisition started, the time-averaged I(Q), and the correlation
functions.  Each script used to carry its own copy of these readers, so a reader
comparing two scripts had to check four near-identical blocks to be sure they
really were identical.  They live here once instead, and every script imports
them, so all four figures provably read the files the same way.

Nothing here modifies a file: every caller opens the HDF read-only, and these
functions only fetch.
