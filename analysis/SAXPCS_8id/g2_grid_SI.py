"""Figure S10: 2x2 grid of XPCS g2(tau) for the 4 non-primary q bins.

This figure is an EXPANSION of Figure 3b onto the four higher q bins: Figure 3b
shows q index 0, this shows q indices 1-4.  It therefore has to show the same
model, fitted the same way -- so the curves here come from exactly the same
global fit that produces Figure 3c and Figure S9, imported from xpcs_fit.py.

For each elapsed time the five q bins are fitted SIMULTANEOUSLY with the two
stretching exponents shared across q and the contrast fixed at the measured
instrumental value; the curve drawn in each panel is that global solution
evaluated at that panel's q.  (Previously this script carried its own private
copy of the model which fitted each q bin independently with both exponents
frozen at 0.5, so the caption's description of the fits did not match the
curves; the parameters shown here are now the ones the paper reports.)
