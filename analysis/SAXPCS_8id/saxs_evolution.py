"""Figure S8: full SAXS 1d evolution for all B0147 files (D0138 subtracted).

Every B0147 averaged file is plotted, coloured by elapsed time (time origin =
first B0147 file, frames 1-200).  B0146 (6 C reference, before the 30 C
isothermal) is drawn in the same blue square as the 6 C reference in Figure 3a,
and the y axis carries the same label, so the two figures key and label that
dataset identically.

Elapsed time is keyed by a COLOURBAR rather than by an 11-entry legend box.  The
curves are stacked in y across the whole q range, so there is no corner of the
axes a box that size can sit in without covering data; the colourbar carries the
same information outside the frame.  The colormap is plasma, the same
elapsed-time colour language used in the main XPCS figure (and, unlike the turbo
scale used before, it is legible with colour-vision deficiency) -- but note the
two figures normalise over different time spans, so read the value off this bar
rather than matching hues between figures.
