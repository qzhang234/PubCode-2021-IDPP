"""Restore into the NeXus tree the measured values the 2025 rewrite dropped.

BEAMLINE-ONLY.  This script has to see /gdata, which is mounted on the 10.x
hosts (amber) and not on the 164.x analysis machines, so it cannot run from a
clone of the repository.  It is kept here for provenance: it documents exactly
how the data the figures are built from came to be what they are.

WHY IT EXISTS
-------------
The 2022-1 beamtime was recorded in the Data Exchange schema.  In 2025 the
metadata were rewritten into ``babnigg202203_nexus`` so the current
``boost_corr_bin``, which reads NeXus only, could reprocess the 2022 frames.
The rewrite carried the detector data across intact but wrote constants in
place of four quantities that were actually measured:

    NeXus destination                                       value after rewrite
    /entry/instrument/incident_beam/incident_beam_intensity      133.49012809232
    /entry/instrument/incident_beam/transmitted_beam_intensity            0.0001
    /entry/instrument/incident_beam/ring_current                             0.0
    /entry/start_time, /entry/end_time                       the 2025 rewrite date

The first two are the upstream and downstream ion chambers.  abs_xsec.py turns
them into the incident flux and the sample transmission, so with the constants
in place every absolute cross section is wrong: the implied transmission is
8.6e-07 instead of 0.35 and the implied flux is negative.

The originals survive in the 2022 archive, which the NeXus rewrite never
touched, under measurement/instrument/source_begin and source_end.  This script
copies them back.

WHAT IT WRITES
--------------
Only the derived ``babnigg202203_nexus`` tree.  The 2022 archive is opened
read-only and is never modified.  Within the NeXus tree both levels are
written: the per-acquisition ``*_metadata.hdf``, so that a future reprocessing
inherits the measured values instead of the constants, and the
``reprocess_results/*_results.hdf`` that average_ranges.py reads.

A field is written only when it still holds the exact constant the 2025 rewrite
left.  A field already holding the archive value is skipped, so the script is
idempotent; anything else is left alone and reported, so a value somebody has
already corrected by hand cannot be clobbered.

Every restored value is written to a manifest CSV, which is committed to the
repository as the record of what this script changed.

Usage
-----
    python restore_dx_metadata.py              # dry run; writes the manifest only
    python restore_dx_metadata.py --apply      # perform the writes
    python restore_dx_metadata.py --limit 50   # first 50 acquisitions, for a smoke test
