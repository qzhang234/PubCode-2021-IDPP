"""Incident photon flux at 8-ID-I from the calibrated PIN-diode current.

This is the flux-conversion formula behind Figure S10.  Running the file prints
the unattenuated full-beam flux for the single PIN-diode reading recorded on
2025-02-01 (see PINdiode_Calibration_DP00429_2024-02-01.pdf); the per-condition
fluxes in the figure legend are computed by g2_SAXPCS_Rad_Cali.py, which
reimplements the same formula and drives it from each measurement's own
ion-chamber reading instead.

    beam power   = PIN current / spectral responsivity
    raw flux     = beam power / (photon energy in joules)
    corrected    = raw flux / (mirror and window losses)

NOTE: the constants below describe the post-APS-Upgrade 8-ID configuration used
for this control measurement (2025), not the 2022 main experiment.

# ev2J is the charge of a single electron, e, in coulombs.  One electron-volt is
# the energy an electron gains across a one-volt potential, so 1 eV = e joules
# and multiplying an energy in eV by e converts it to joules.
# 1.6e-19 is e rounded to two digits, 0.14 % below the exact value
# (e = 1.602176634e-19 C).  That is far inside the uncertainty on the diode
# responsivity and the loss factors, and it does not move any flux quoted in
# Figure S10, whose legend carries one digit after the point.
